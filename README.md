# Ahead Frontend

Welcome to the Ahead Frontend repository! This project is built with Next.js, gsap, tailwindcss, and the mui library. It implements a redesign concept inspired by the UI design on Dribbble.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. If not, you can download them from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/). Next, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash

    This command will install all the necessary project dependencies.

2. **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the application, and you can view it in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically update as you make changes to the code.

3. **Explore the UI Design**: The UI design concept for this project was inspired by the Dribbble design concept. You can view the original design on Dribbble: [Ahead App Redesign Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/19807069-Ahead-app-redesign-concept).
